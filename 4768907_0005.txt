This ree! of microfiim contains materiai
which hes paper color changes stains, or
illustrations (some ot which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that eii text and illustrations are
lemme, exposure settinqs must be changed. κ

Therefore, when text end illustrations exist
in e single image or when materiai
bacquourids differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camera
operator’s best effert to capture the majority
ot the text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effort to capture
iii'ustrative materiai or tite remaining] text. it

is hoped that this practice witi result in a
microtiim product that fuiiy serves tite needs

of most researctters.
